# Situaci√≥n

Just imagine: you have a garden and you want not only to know yourself what trees you have in your garden, you also want to share this knowledge with others, and you decided you want to make it visible through the OpenStreetMap site. that is, you decided to identify your plants, geo-reference them, put this information on the OSM repository, in a way that is compatible with the OSM guidelines.
The above case might apply to private citizens, but most likely it is the case of a municipality, wanting to advertise the presence, health, location of trees in their public gardens.
