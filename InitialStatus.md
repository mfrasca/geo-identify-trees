# Situation — geo

 What information is available, and what knowledge.
## Geo-referenced map
 In presence of the above, you would probably best just pin-point the trees on the map, by hand, on paper or better making use of a GIS program, like QGIS. 
You might also want to put the information in OSM, if property licenses are compatible.
## Geo-referenced aerial picture
 Similar as above, but possibly less recognizable and in need of quality check.
more so than in previous case, you will definitely want to put this information in OSM, then use OSM to produce a printable map of your garden.
## Sparse trees, no references
 In this case I suggest you produce some reference lines in the map that will allow you locate your sparse individuals. Record GPS traces along straight lines that you can associate to tree locations. Keeping all GPS recording in a straight line, one idea is to walk from one tree to the other. An other option is to walk towards the most remarkable trees staying as far as possible from other trees. Repeat the procedure several times, then use the intersections and crossings you have recorded.
## Dense trees, no references
Keep in mind that canopy will obstruct GPS signal, and that the resulting error needs not be random, as the canopy will likely not be homogeneous. Please DO NOT trust GPS data when collected close to asymmetrical obstacles. You will get a systematic error if you take a GPS reading while standing next to a building. You will get a large random error in presence of thick tree canopy, in particular after rain or in presence of high humidity. In the same condition, there is no guarantee that the large random error will not contain a systematic component. 
In this case start by collecting GPS traces along the border of your area, or follow the most relevant paths within the area. Put this information in OSM, print the map using FieldPapers, then work by triangulating. Measure distances from corners of crossings, as identified in the previous step, then expand the referenced area bit by bit.
Or hire a professional.
