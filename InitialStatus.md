# Situation

what information is available, and what knowledge.
## georeferenced map
in presence of the above, you would probably best just pin-point the trees on the map, by hand, on paper or better making use of a GIS program, like QGIS. 
you might also want to put the information in OSM, if property licenses are compatible.
## georeferenced aerial picture
similar as above, but possibly less recognizable and likely in need of quality check.
more so than in previous case, you will definitely want to put this information in OSM, then use OSM to produce a printable map of your garden.
## sparse trees, no references
in this case I suggest you produce some reference lines in the map, you might want to record GPS traces along straight lines that you can easily associate to tree locations, like walk from one tree to the other, or walk towards the most remarkable trees, in a straight line, as far as possible from other trees.
## dense trees, no references
keep in mind that canopy will obstruct GPS signal, and that the resulting error needs not be random, as the canopy will likely not be homogeneous. please DO NOT trust GPS data when collected close to asymmetrical obstacles, like standing next to a building, or in presence of thick tree canopy, in particular after rain or in presence of high humidity. start by referencing the border of your area, or bigger paths within the area, then work by triangulating, measuring distances and double checking at each step.
or hire a professional.
